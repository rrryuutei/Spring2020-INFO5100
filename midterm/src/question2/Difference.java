    //1.A Class can implement multiple interfacesï¼Œwhile The class can inherit only one Abstract Class
           // 2.In case of Abstract Class, you can take advantage of the default implementation.
     // 3. interface only definition, can not have the implementation of the method,while abstract classes can have definitions and implementations, and methods can be implemented in abstract classes.
      //4.Interfaces emphasize the implementation of specific functions, while abstract classes emphasize affiliation.
 // 5.Interface variables are public static final by default, must be assigned initial values, and cannot be modified.all its member methods are public, abstract variables in abstract classes default, can be redefined in subclasses and can be reassigned.
    // 6.In an abstract interface keyword, is optional for declaring a method as an abstract,whileIn an abstract class, the abstract keyword is compulsory for declaring a method as an abstract.
//7.An interface can inherit multiple interfaces but cannot inherit a class.But An abstract class can inherit a class and multiple interfaces.
